                        3 Best Website Designs of 2021
                    </h3>

                    <p class="text-dark mt-3 p-2">
                        Your website is the first impression someone has of your
                        business, so it makes sense that you want to put your
                        best foot forward. The sites that have made this list of
                        the Top 5 Best & Worst Website Designs of 2021 show why
                        well-planned design and a solid marketing strategy make
                        a huge difference. What you’ll see here is that when it
                        comes to website development, a truly awful site stands
                        out just as much as an exceptionally well-designed one.

                            Landing on the site, you’re intrigued with the
                            visuals — a sleek logo and simple hero heading on a
                            muted almost mysterious backdrop of tropical
                            feathers, and the beckoning “Click to discover”
                            button that calls you to action. The website takes
                            you on a journey through story, sound, and 3D
                            visuals that is unexpected and deeply compelling.

                            As a site to feature the work of an Italian comic
                            writer, this website design works brilliantly. All
                            in black and white, it’s a portfolio treatment but
                            with an edge. Music, a day/night feature that
                            changes the look and feel, and a body of work that
                            keeps people engaged, this clean site offers easy
                            navigation through a gallery portfolio of the
                            artist’s adult comics and concept art. And it’s all
                            set to a techno beat that’s reminiscent of 60’s rat
                            pack chic.

                                class="text"

                            Creating an interactive and immersive digital ride,
                            Apple’s AirPods Pro site uses 3D graphics and an
                            interactivity that goes beyond scrolling and
                            clicking. This technique transcends the typical
                            ecommerce drawback of selling a product that you
                            can’t touch or try out and creates a creative
                            discovery experience that positively impacts sales.
                            Upon landing on the site, there is a crisp, clean
                            black background and an image of the AirPods, but no
                            indication of what to do. Intuitively, you scroll
                            (as intended) entering a storytelling experience
                            that packs a “Wow” punch that highlights the
                            technology and the advanced features that make this
                            product sought after by early adopters and regular
                            users alike.

                    <p class="text-dark mt-3 p-2">
                        While offline retail is definitely not dying, e-commerce
                        retail has most certainly been growing. Since 2010,
                        e-commerce sales have almost tripled as a percentage of
                        total sales. While that makes for a healthy market, it
                        also means it is a very competitive one as well. As a
                        top digital marketing firm, understanding the nuances
                        needed for e-commerce businesses is important. That is
                        why we wanted to share the e-commerce digital marketing
                        tips you need to know. Information is power, and in this
                        case, can also mean more profitability.

                            <b>Utilize Reviews</b> – Customer reviews are one of
                            the most powerful marketing tools a business can
                            have. The only exception is if your products or
                            services are awful. But let’s be honest, if that was
                            the case you likely are not reading this. Reviews
                            offer two ways to benefit your business. The direct
                            impact is their ability to increase trust and
                            confidence in your business. Positive and real
                            reviews act as social proof to other customers,
                            support the ability of your products to meet their
                            needs. The second benefit is providing additional
                            information to potential customers. In some cases,
                            prior customers will point out features or uses that
                            you had not thought of promoting.
                        </p>

                            <b>Use Good Pop-ups</b> – There are good pop-up ads
                            and bad ones. The difference between the two is
                            simple; timing. Bad pop-ups are intrusive, often
                            appearing too soon before a customer is engaged. A
                            good pop-up acts as a reminder or provides an added
                            incentive to help nudge a customer towards a
                            purchase decision; but only after a reasonable time
                            or action triggers the ad. For example, a well-timed
                            “10% off your first purchase” ad can appear after a
                            reasonable amount of time is spent on a product
                            page. Free shipping, buy-one-get-one, or free gift
                            ads also work well. When a customer is engaged, then
                            provide the push.

                            <b>Use Google</b> – The behemoth of the internet can
                            greatly aid e-commerce sites with their highly
                            effective Google Shopping Campaigns. The beauty of a
                            well-crafted campaign is that it puts ads in front
                            of customers based on relevant query searches. It is
                            a win-win-win situation for consumers, Google, and
                            of course, your business. Take the time to learn
                            about the specifics of campaigns, the different
                            structures, as well as understanding product data
                            feeds. This will increase the ROI from the get-go
                            rather than splashing around aimlessly.

                            interface between Facebook and Instagram, it is
                            relatively easy to sell products directly from
                            Instagram. Rather than just liking a product
                            picture, they can click directly through to a sales
                            page. This creates more of a “one-touch” shopping
                            experience. Removing steps in the buying process
                            increase both customer satisfaction and the average
                            speed of the transaction. Also, keep other social
                            media platforms in mind as a sales platform. If your
                            audience demographic uses Pinterest, selling there
                            with Shoppable Pins makes sense as well.

                    <hr />
                    <p class="text-dark p-2">
                        Due to the unfortunate need for social distancing, many
                        people are being sent home to work. This can be
                        difficult for those who have not spent a great deal of
                        time working remotely. However, the transaction can be a
                        bit smoother by following many of the ideas outlined
                        here in our Top Tips for Working from home.
                        <br />
                        Some of the most important tips that we will share are
                        related to the mental aspect of working from home. This
                        is important to understand as you consider how to
                        implement various ideas. Being able to stay mentally
                        fresh does take effort and planning but it is critical
                        when you combine your workspace with your leisure space.

                        </h5>

                            <b>Create a Private Work Area</b> – Privacy is an
                            absolute must to work effectively from home. Avoid
                            setting up an office on centralized locations like a
                            kitchen table or living room couch. An extra bedroom
                            is ideal. Using a garage can be an excellent
                            short-term solution if the parking space isn’t a
                            necessity. You should have a door, good lighting, a
                            stable workspace such as a table or desk, and proper
                            electrical outlets, internet, and phone connections.
                            A dedicated workspace is not associated with your
                            leisure time and helps put you in the work mindset.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-dark p-2">
                            <b>Use Dedicated Internet</b> – If you don’t have a
                            dedicated internet line at your house, get one.
                            Consider upgrading either your speed package or
                            router if you need faster performance or more
                            bandwidth. For people using laptops, use a hardwire
                            connection to your router. While wireless is great,
                            in some cases it can cause issues with some software
                            platforms. A dedicated line will be faster and more
                            secure.
                        </p>

                            <b>Review your Job Tools</b> – By job tools we mean
                            anything essential to your daily activities. Do you
                            have all of the same software downloaded to the
                            device you are using for work? Do you need to print
                            documents? Sign documents? Have video conferences?
                            Do you need a headset for phone calls while typing?
                            Do you need new apps like DropBox for file-sharing
                            or Slack for communication or Rescue Time to keep
                            you focused? Run through your daily, weekly, and
                            monthly tasks to make sure you have everything to
                            function and also be aware of what needs to be taken
                            care of. In some cases, modified processes will need
                            to be created for some functions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-dark p-2">
                            <b>Start Early</b> – You can accomplish a lot when
                            you start early when your mind is the freshest. Many
                            of us who work from home start the coffee brewing
                            and dive right into the day. Try to knock out the
                            toughest task before breakfast, which then becomes a
                            well-deserved reward! When you start slow,
                            motivation can lag which can be a problem within the
                            comforts of home surrounding you.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-dark p-2">
                            <b>Stay Connected</b> – Working from home can be
                            isolating, especially for people who live alone.
                            Many people get used to those daily interactions
                            with fellow employees. Instant messaging apps and
                            video calls are both great ways to stay connected.
                            If you have a family at home, make sure to interact
                            with them as well.
