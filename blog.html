          3 Best Website Designs of 2021
        </h4>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Your website is the first impression someone has of your business,
          so it makes sense that you want to put your best foot forward. The
          sites that have made this list of the Top 5 Best & Worst Website
          Designs of 2021 show why well-planned design and a solid marketing
          strategy make a huge difference. What you’ll see here is that when
          it comes to website development, a truly awful site stands out just
          as much as an exceptionally well-designed one.
        </p>

          <h5 class="fw-normal">Good Meat</h5>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Landing on the site, you’re intrigued with the visuals — a sleek
            logo and simple hero heading on a muted almost mysterious backdrop
            of tropical feathers, and the beckoning “Click to discover” button
            that calls you to action. The website takes you on a journey
            through story, sound, and 3D visuals that is unexpected and deeply
            compelling.

          Ecommerce Digital Marketing Tips You Need to Know
        </h4>
        <hr />
        <p>
          While offline retail is definitely not dying, e-commerce retail has
          most certainly been growing. Since 2010, e-commerce sales have
          almost tripled as a percentage of total sales. While that makes for
          a healthy market, it also means it is a very competitive one as
          well. As a top digital marketing firm, understanding the nuances
          needed for e-commerce businesses is important. That is why we wanted
          to share the e-commerce digital marketing tips you need to know.
          Information is power, and in this case, can also mean more
          profitability.

        <div class="blog-2-content">
          <h5 class="fw-normal">Utilize Reviews</h5>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Customer reviews are one of the most powerful marketing tools a
            business can have. The only exception is if your products or
            services are awful. But lets be honest, if that was the case you
            likely are not reading this. Reviews offer two ways to benefit
            your business. The direct impact is their ability to increase
            trust and confidence in your business. Positive and real reviews
            act as social proof to other customers, support the ability of
            your products to meet their needs. The second benefit is providing
            additional information to potential customers. In some cases,
            prior customers will point out features or uses that you had not
            thought of promoting.

        <h4>Top Tips for Working from Home</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Due to the unfortunate need for social distancing, many people are
          being sent home to work. This can be difficult for those who have
          not spent a great deal of time working remotely. However, the
          transaction can be a bit smoother by following many of the ideas
          outlined here in our Top Tips for Working from home. Some of the
          most important tips that we will share are related to the mental
          aspect of working from home.
        </p>
        <div class="blog-3-content">
          <h5 class="fw-normal">Create a Private Work Area</h5>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Privacy is an absolute must to work effectively from home. Avoid
            setting up an office on centralized locations like a kitchen table
            or living room couch. An extra bedroom is ideal. Using a garage
            can be an excellent short-term solution if the parking space isn’t
            a necessity. You should have a door, good lighting, a stable
            workspace such as a table or desk, and proper electrical outlets,
            internet, and phone connections. A dedicated workspace is not
            associated with your leisure time and helps put you in the work
            mindset.
